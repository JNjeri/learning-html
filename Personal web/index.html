<h3>Expirience</h3>
<p>
	A whole new world has opened up to me through photography: DSLR cameras, lenses, tripods, picture editing programs, filters, composition, and light. Now it has already been more than two years since I bought my first DSLR camera and everyone who sees my photos is always impressed and I usually receive very positive feedback. Many people send emails and ask me what camera I’m using. On the whole I’m naturally quite proud that I have made progress, but the success is definitely due to the fact that I didn’t give up and that I have always remained curious. On the other hand I think that constructive feedback wouldn’t be bad either, because it would help me to understand my mistakes and to improve them.
